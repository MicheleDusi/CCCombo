# Compact Compiled Combinator
*A simple tool for affordable parameters setting.*

## What?
Imagine you have a project or an algorithm working on different parameters, and you don't know exactly what values they should have. You think a good idea is to try out some configurations until you find the one that succeeds. But then you realize that not all the configurations are valid, not all the parameters could have the same values, some should change while other should remain fixed, and the ranges within they change depends on other values and other constraints.
In practice, the whole values-combining procedure is a mess.

Introducing **Compact Compiled Combinator**, *a tool that I'm pretty sure it exists in many other implementations, but I had time and I made up my own.*

**CCCombo**, aka **Com.Com.Com**, aka **Compa-Compi-Combi**, aka **CoCoNat**, aka **CoCCo**, is a simple program with the specific purpose of making the parameters setting an affordable challenge. I made something similar for one of my C++ projects, but it was too domain-dependent, so I decided to extract the main ideas behind to create this new stand-alone implementation.

I also wanted to try and learn [Raku](https://raku.org/) (aka **Perl 6**), so I though it could be interesting to code the project in this new language.
Is this going to be a bad idea? Definitely, but since this is not a "life-changing" software, this could still be worth it.

So, why am I publishing this *unfinished*, *unspecial* and *maybe-not-so-well-coded* project?
1. To force myself to finish it.
2. If the previous point works, to share it with other people. (I have no expectations, don't worry about that).
3. If the previous point succeeds, to improve it by receiving suggestions, critiques and help.
